# Skork Engine Framework by Anthony J (Reapism) [Private]
**Skork Engine ** is the sequel to the original [Skork](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork) project.

**Skork** (SCORE-K) is a custom programming language for writing a game with rules *you define*. Skork allows you to test code in a 
visual way using *sprites*. You can visual your code using primitive variables, loops, and sprites. My audience is anyone 
interested enough to write in a simplified programming language, and visualize code in a different way! Feel free to fork it 
and make any update/addition/deletion you want.

## All Skork related projects.
Three distinct projects! 
* *[Windows based GUI](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork-Engine) implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.*
* **Skork Engine framework itself! (private)**
* *Web based implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.* (COMING SOON)
This is the GUI focused implementation of the Skork Engine framework. There is also a web based implementation of the Skork
framework. This will be slowly developed overtime! 


# FAQ 
### Is the Skork engine open sourced?
This project itself is open sourced. This refers to the GUI of the Skork Engine, and the interaction with the Skork-Engine 
framework. The actual Skork framework is **not open sourced** at this time. Since the rebirth of this project, I decided to
go for a large database role by storing all profiles and preferences in the cloud.

### What is the Skork Engine framework?
It's the barebones API for parsing text into code, compiling it, interpreting it, and running it! The Skork framework 
delegates an amount of resources based on the priortity. This project is an **implementation** of the framework. 

### What is Skork Engine used for?
Since its a programming language, technically, its uses are up to you. What makes this simplified programming language
different than the others is that it is revolved around sprites which are a visual indicator of the code. You can create
a "game" with a ruleset you define statically or dynamically through code. It provides an easy way to visualize a ruleset
or function.
